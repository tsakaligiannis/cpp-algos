# cpp-algos

A curated collection of algorithmic problem solutions implemented in **C++**.  
This repository showcases efficient and well-structured solutions to problems in **combinatorial optimization**, **graph theory**, **greedy algorithms**, **binary search on answer**, and more â€” many of which were developed as part of an academic course on **Algorithms and Complexity**.

Each problem is contained in its own subdirectory with:
- A `main.cpp` implementation
- A `README.md` with a clear problem definition, input/output format, example, and explanation
